## 10. AI Integration Notes (Cline & GPT)

Cline (or any connected AI workspace) uses this file as **grounding context**.  
All generated code or UI should:
- Respect offline-first requirements  
- Use correct data field names from rollout docs (CIP, PRD, SDS)  
- Avoid cloud-only dependencies  
- Follow the section order and UX conventions defined here  
- Provide bilingual label keys in `/i18n/en.json` and `/i18n/es.json`
